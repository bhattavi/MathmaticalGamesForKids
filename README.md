# MathmaticalGamesForKids
Just a simple multiplication quiz for kids using java.
The program will ask random one digit multiplication questions.
If you will get it wrong then it will keep repeating the same question till you will get it right.
Otherwise, if the answer is correct then it will ask another question.
And you can enter "-1" anytime to exit the program.
Thank You.
